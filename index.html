  // Text to be typed out
  var text = "Hi, my name is Noah Solano and I am currently a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing a bachelor of arts degree in Computer Science with a minor in Space. I have always been fascinated by computers and the latest technologies emerging in society. This initially stemmed from a love for the sheer amount of creativity, pure logic, and structure that is behind every device we use. I have various interests outside of CS but my main goal in my professional life is to blend my knowledge of CS with those various passions. As a result, one of my main areas of study in CS surrounds web design and development. Although recently I have developed a keen passion for Cyber Security as well. Outside interests also include Astronomy and anything concerning what lies beyond our immediate environment, hence the minor study in Space. I think many individuals in fields of science are fixated on the accumulation of pure structured knowledge, which is what initially drew me to CS. I can confidently say this is not the case for myself, if you love what you do you will never work a day in your life and I plan on exercising this philosophy to the fullest of my ability.";
