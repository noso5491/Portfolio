        <h2>ThoughtSpot</h2>
        <p>An online journal where one may log daily activities whether it be for themselves exclusively, open to the public, or restricted to a select few peers. It will include different formats and functions depending on the user's intentions and goals. It can provide mental relief/stimulus and help you develop your mindfulness/introspection through a system that is typical of a physical form. All entries will be saved to a database so that users can easily access their profiles and postings from nearly any device.
