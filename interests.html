            I have been working in the service industry for years. Most of which has been in coffee shops at this point. I fell in love with coffee, drink mixology, and everything to do with being a Barista!

            Brazilian Jiu-jitsu: I wrestled in high school and briefly did BJJ around the age of 10. So once I graduated I decided to give it another chance and instantly fell in love with the sport. Not only is it a great sport but I am honoured to be a part of an amazing community at Easton Longmont. This is technically one of two part-time jobs but it is genuinely more out of passion. I have been coaching kids classes and have become much more involved in the community than I ever anticipated when I first began the sport.
